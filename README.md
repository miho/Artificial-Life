### University Final Year Project

This project was my final year project, intened to demonstrate the use of Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming.

The experiment used either a genetic algorithm or a genetic program to power my Artificial life form.

The project creates an environment for the artificial life based on some programmed parameters and the project will 
go through many iterations of the life form and find the most optimal one. A Swing GUI is also used to display the results
of the process of the genetic algorithm or program as the life form evolves in the enviroment.

This project relies on JGAP for the underlying genetic algorithm and program computation.
